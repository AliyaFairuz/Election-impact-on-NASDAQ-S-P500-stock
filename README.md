# U.S. Election Impact on Equities 
As a part of my Capstone project at Duke, I worked on a project that analyzed the impact of 2024 US election events upon stock returns. The project entailed:

1. Building a Python-based model to observe market volatility during US elections using NASDAQ and S&P 500 returns, political news headlines, and Google Trends. I experimented with different data sets from headlines to search trends to observe political sentiment.
2. I identified important election events as a part of the event study and then observed 3 day and 5 day rolling windows. Ultimately the Ridge regression model based on news headline sentiments yielded the best explanatory power. 
3. Trained GARCH, XGBoost, and NLP models to forecast returns. I also optimized the model with regularization and clustering (RÂ² = 0.87). 
4. Ultimately, I visualized forecasts in Tableau and Python, highlighting macro shifts and political catalysts to support strategic asset allocation for investors.
